# Go Project
### Where to Watch: Media Search Engine


Purpose
======
The purpose of this project was to make something using Go and the Go-Resty client. The project involved learning how to use Go, as well as several other libraries to support it. 

This project presents a simple search function, that allows you to search for a movie or TV show. It then calls the Utelly API which searches several streaming media pages, and returns a result of where you can watch that show.

Future Iterations
======
Future items I would like to tackle on this project include:
* A log in and rating feature for movies/tv shows
* A "watch list" for movies or tv shows that people recommend
* Potential social integration for other people to see what movies you watched recently
